These are sample program for convex optimization in MATLAB. The program using
'cvx' library of MATLAB. The 'cvx' library is one of the most comprehensed library 
for convex optimization. 

Please follow its installation on cvxr.com/cvx/

cvx_program.m : the convex function used converges to a solution.
cvx_program2.m : example of convex function with doesn't converges to an optimal solution. The solution obtained is not optimal.

Have a look at my Non-separable SVM program using convex optimization.
